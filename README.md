Virtualgamecoin open source information.

We are trying to build a decentralized internet facility. Instead of DNS, all access is guided by miners, and all data is stored anonymously in IPFS.

You can freely do anything through it. No country or organization can control it.VGCers can use VGC to pay and trade with each other in VGC ecology applications.

VGCTeam donâ€™t have any marketing and public relations activities. We only focus about technology development. Everything is self-organized by the consensus of vgcer and major decentralized communities. You can find other vgcers by yourself through Facebook / Telegram or other social applications.
